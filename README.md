# Project Euler Walk-through
This project is designed to create an educational, exploratory walk-through of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) concepts and solutions. [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) is intended as the main interface to explore notes on mathematical concepts and explanations, while solutions are provided in Python.

Since this intended for educational purposes, and to avoid conflict with [Eulerian](https://projecteuler.net/eulerians) rankings, no solutions or answers will be presented for recent problems.

The [[Problem Index]] provides a good jumping-off point.
